That’s over. It needs to be about American ingenuity. If you unleash American ingenuity, the scale by which we will outrun, outpace, outperform the rest of the world will be incredible.”\\n“It is a broad set of regulations that are holding back America,” he said. “A lesser regulatory environment will unleash America and we will be much, much better off with less of a hand on our head holding us down and more arms carrying us up.”\\nLutnick repeatedly emphasized his goal to adopt Commerce’s model on cyber regulations to the rules for AI regulation.\\n“It has to be an American-driven leadership in AI,” Lutnick said. “Leverage what we’re great at, and issue standards and practices like we did in cyber that will encourage [the] private sector to be the dominant winner as we are in America.”\\nLutnick elaborated further on the goals he has with regulation and said he wants the United States to dominate global standards for AI production.\\n“I think we should try to have a light touch model in AI,” Lutnick said. “Set up standards so the world heeds our standards and goes with our standards would be very important for America and something I’m going to try to drive.”\\nWhen asked about the CHIPS and Science Act, Lutnick seemed hesitant to fully embrace the act. He appeared to have other ideas for increasing domestic semiconductor production.\\n“The CHIPS Act was an excellent down payment to begin that process,” Lutnick said of increased domestic semiconductor production. “We need to study it, but we need to make sure that we get the benefit of the bargain, and domestic manufacturing of semiconductors happens in America.”\\nThroughout his testimony, Lutnick continuously referred to his policy on tariffs, mentioning that he would use Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to leverage them against China, specifically regarding tools used in developing AI and large language models.\\n“If they’re going to compete with us, let them compete with us,” Lutnick said in reference to China’s DeepSeek AI model. “But stop using our tools to compete with us.”\\n“I’m thrilled to coordinate and empower BIS with tariffs,” he continued. “When we say no, the answer has got to be no.”\\n\\nRead More About\\n\\nCivilian Agencies \\nRecent\\n \\n\\n\\nGAO: IRS Boosts E-Filing but Paper Still Clogs Process\\n\\nLawmakers Condemn Trump-Musk Move to Shutter USAID\\n\\nDoD Exempt From White House Civilian Hiring Freeze\\n\\n \\n\\nMore Topics\\n \\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCategories\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\n\\n CIO Briefing Room\\n\\nCDM\\n\\nCritical Infrastructure\\n\\nFederal CIO Council\\n\\nFedRAMP\\n\\nFISMA\\n\\nFITARA\\n\\nMGT Act\\n\\nPrivacy & Civil Liberties\\n\\nSupply Chain\\n\\nTBM\\n\\nTMF\\n\\nZero Trust\\nCivilian Agencies\\n\\nAgriculture\\n\\nCFTC\\n\\nCMS\\n\\nCommerce\\n\\nNOAA\\n\\nNTIA\\n\\nUSPTO\\nEducation\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\nEPA\\n\\nFCC\\n\\nFDIC\\n\\nFEC\\n\\nFEMA\\n\\nFTC\\n\\nGeneral Services Administration\\n\\nGovernment Accountability Office\\n\\nHealth and Human Services\\n\\nNIH\\nHomeland Security\\n\\nCISA\\n\\nUSCIS\\nHousing and Urban Development\\n\\nInterior\\n\\nIRS\\n\\nJustice\\n\\nLabor\\n\\nNASA\\n\\nNational Science Foundation\\n\\nNIST\\n\\nNuclear Regulatory Commission\\n\\nOPM\\n\\nSEC\\n\\nSmall Business Administration\\n\\nSocial Security Administration\\n\\nState\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nFAA\\nTreasury\\n\\nUSAID\\n\\nVeterans Affairs\\nCongress\\n\\nBudget\\n\\nHearings / Oversight\\n\\nLegislation\\nDefense & Intelligence\\n\\nAir Force\\n\\nArmy\\n\\nCIA\\n\\nDARPA\\n\\nDIA\\n\\nDISA\\n\\nDIU\\n\\nDOD CIO\\n\\nFBI\\n\\nGEOINT\\n\\nIARPA\\n\\nJAIC\\n\\nMarine Corps\\n\\nNavy\\n\\nNGA\\n\\nNSA\\n\\nNuclear\\n\\nODNI\\n\\nSpace Force\\n\\nU.S. Cyber Command\\nDEI\\n\\nDEIA\\n\\nEmerging Tech\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\n\\nBig Data\\n\\nBlockchain\\n\\nBroadband\\n\\nCloud Computing\\n\\nCustomer Experience\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\nData Center\\n\\nData Management\\n\\nDigital Service\\n\\nElection Security\\n\\nHealth IT\\n\\nHybrid Cloud Infrastructre\\n\\nIndustry\\n\\nInnovation\\n\\nInternet of Things\\n\\nMobility\\n\\nOpen Government\\n\\nQuantum\\n\\nTelework\\nHappy Holidays\\n\\nIndustry News\\n\\nJudiciary\\n\\nSupreme Court\\nWhite House\\n\\nNARA\\n\\nOMB\\n\\nONCD\\n\\nOSTP\\n\\nU.S. Digital Service\\nWorkforce Issues\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nSTEM\\n\\nWomen in Tech\\n\\nAbout\\nAndrew Rice\\n\\nAndrew Rice is a MeriTalk Staff Reporter covering the intersection of government and technology.\\n\\nTags\\n\\nAICommerceDepartment of CommerceSenatetariffs \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nConnect with MeriTalk\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t921 King St., Alexandria, Virginia 22314\\ninfo@meritalk.com\\n\\nHome\\nNews\\nEvents\\nResearch\\nOpinion\\nMeriTV\\nPodcasts\\nAwards\\nState & Local\\nFITARA\\n \\nAbout\\nAdvertise\\nContact\\nPrivacy\\n \\nSubscribe\\n\\n\\nFirst Name*Last Name*Email*\\n\\nURLNameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\\n  \\nΔ\\n198 queries. 2.654 seconds.\\nWe may use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our website, to show you personalized content and targeted ads, to analyze our website traffic, and to understand where our visitors are coming from.
